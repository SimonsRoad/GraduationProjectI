Nvidia-Digits Installation on Ubuntu 16.04

- Nvidia Driver, Cuda and cuDnn:
[Install Nvidia Driver and CUDA](https://gist.github.com/wangruohui/df039f0dc434d6486f5d4d098aa52d07)

I recommend that installing nvidia driver with apt-get. It is better and you can be sure about driver compatibility. If you install newer version, you may have to face with problems like login loop or GUI shutdown.

While moving cuDnn library to /usr/local, you may have to change the name from "cuda" to "cuDnn".

  Installing Prerequisites and Dependencies are easy parts. But while installing caffe, I faced with three problems.
1. Missing protobuf. Can be fixed with:
  [Protobuf library error](https://github.com/szagoruyko/loadcaffe/issues/76)
2. Gcc is not supported. Can be fixed with:
  [Gcc error](https://gist.github.com/wangruohui/679b05fcd1466bb0937f)
3. memcpy error. Can be fixed with:
[memcpy error](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/4046)
